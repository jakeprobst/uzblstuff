        there doesnt seem to be a guide for setting up uzbl and how all the stuff
        works together, so here is my attempt at fixing that.
      </div>

      <div class="item">
        <strong>install</strong><br />
        <div class="subitem">
          grab and compile the latest tarball off of the <a href="http://uzbl.org">uzbl</a>
          site. package managers are usually either out of date (the uzbl developers like 
          breaking backwards compatiblility regularly) or do odd stuff, so using the
          source from the main page or git is recommended.

        <strong>uzbl's parts</strong><br/>
        <div class="subitem">
          uzbl-core<br/>
          this just shows a webkit view and throws events, useless on its own dont
          run this.
          <br/><br />
          uzbl-event-manager<br>
          this is what handles the events that uzbl-core outputs. uzbl-browser
          will launch this if it is not already running
          <br/><br/>
          uzbl-browser<br/>
          this is what you want to run, it is a shell script that wraps the calls
          to uzbl-core, uzbl-event-daemon, uzbl-cookie-daemon and sets some variables.
          <br/><br/>
          uzbl-tabbed<br/>
          tabbed interface for uzbl.
          <br/><br/>
          uzbl-cookie-daemon<br/>
          handles cookies. uzbl-browser will launch this if it is not there
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="item">
        <strong>setup</strong>
        <div class="subitem">
          make sure the proper XDG variables are set (XDG_DATA_HOME, XDG_CACHE_HOME,
          XDG_CONFIG_HOME). these default to ~/.local/share, ~/.cache, ~/.config.
          uzbl-browser will set these for you, but be aware these exist.
          on the first run, uzbl-browser should copy the default config from 
          /usr/local/share/uzbl/config to $XDG_CONFIG_HOME/uzbl/.
        </div>
      </div>
      <br />
      <div class="item">
        <strong>config file</strong>
        <div class="subitem">
          this is where all your bindings/settings are defined. <br />
          important variables<br />
          <div class="subsubitem">
            scripts_dir: list of paths where scripts might be located <br />
            status_format: how to format the bar along the bottom <br />
          </div>
          <br />
          bindings
          <div class="subsubitem">
            <tt>set bind = request BIND<br />
            @bind o _ = set uri = %s</tt><br/>
            the request command just sends a user-defined event to the event
            manager to handle. this sends <tt>request BIND o _ = set uri = %s</tt>
            which tells the event manager to make the command o take a string 
            argument (_), and when enter is hit, set uri to whatever the 
            argument was (<tt>o google.com</tt> -> <tt>set uri = google.com</tt>)
            a list of commands and variables can be found in the README
            <br />
            there is also @cbind, which only works in command mode; @ibind, which
            only works in insert mode, and @ebind, which works everywhere not 
            insert mode.
          </div>
          <br />
          events
          <div class="subsubitem">
            <tt>set on_event = request ON_EVENT<br />
            @on_event DOWNLOAD_REQUEST spawn @scripts_dir/download.sh %s \@proxy_url</tt><br />
            note that if you want to use a variable that will change in a 
            command, it needs a \ before it, otherwise it will get replaced when the
            script is loaded.<br />
            this just execs a command when a certain event is raised.
